# polkadot
A low cost, standalone LoRa mesh network using STM32 and the SX1276.

## Firmware
The firmware implements a limited (and highly simplified) version of the AODV routing algorithm. Identical nodes running identical firmware can route a mesh automatically and efficiently without outside intervention. Additional nodes (which can also be running "factory" firmware) will route themselves when they power on.
